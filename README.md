# StreamFlow Manager

## Description
**StreamFlow Manager** is a modular system designed for collecting, processing, and managing data streams from various devices and sources. The application employs a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient real-time data handling.

---

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Data Processing**: Handles incoming data streams for immediate actions and reporting.
2. **Modular Design**: Allows for independent deployment and scaling of specific services.
3. **Messaging System**: Enables efficient communication between components and external systems.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Tracks the performance and health of devices and services, generating alerts when anomalies occur.
5. **Secure API Layer**: Provides authenticated access to manage and interact with the system.

## Logical Flow

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Devices and external systems send data streams to the platform via RESTful APIs or a message broker.
   - The system validates incoming data and directs it to the appropriate modules for processing.

   **Example Workflow**:
   1. Data is ingested through a central API gateway.
   2. Validation ensures that the data conforms to system standards.
   3. The data is routed to processing modules based on its type.

---

### 2. **Data Processing**
   - Each module processes data based on its designated function, such as:
     - Extracting relevant metrics.
     - Detecting patterns or anomalies.
     - Creating actionable outputs for further use.
   - The results are stored or published back into the system for consumption by other components.

   **Example Use Cases**:
   - Analyze environmental data to detect trends over time.
   - Process device logs to identify performance issues or usage statistics.

---

### 3. **Communication Layer**
   - The message broker facilitates asynchronous communication between services, ensuring:
     - Decoupled interactions between components.
     - Scalable and reliable data exchange for high-throughput environments.
   - Supports event-driven architectures, enabling real-time notifications.

   **Use Case**:
   - A processing module identifies an issue with a device and publishes an event.
   - The monitoring service consumes the event and generates an alert.

---

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Continuously monitors system components and devices for health and performance.
   - Generates alerts for:
     - Device failures or offline status.
     - Threshold breaches in data metrics.
     - Service performance issues.
   - Alerts are distributed via APIs, email, or real-time UI notifications.


5. API Layer
The system exposes RESTful APIs for external access and management, offering:
Device management endpoints for creating, updating, or deleting devices.
Data query endpoints for retrieving processed data or statistics.
Alert endpoints for fetching or acknowledging system alerts.



6. Security and Authentication
Secures access with OAuth2-based token authentication.
Implements role-based permissions to manage access levels for sensitive operations.
Logs all access attempts and API interactions for audit purposes.
Security Features:

Automatic token refresh for extended sessions.
IP-based access control for added security.
Additional Features
Historical Data Analysis: Tools for exploring historical trends and performance metrics.
Report Generation: Automated generation of exportable data reports.
Third-Party Integration: Offers APIs for seamless integration with other systems.
Technologies Used
Back-End Framework: .NET 6 with ASP.NET Core.
Database: Microsoft SQL Server.
Microservices: Designed using .NET Core for modularity and scalability.
